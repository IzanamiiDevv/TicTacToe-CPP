# TicTacToe-CPP

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++ for console. It allows two players to play against each other on a 3x3 grid.

## Features

- The game board is displayed in the console, allowing player to see the current state of the game.
- Players take turns marking their symbol (X or O) on the grid until a player wins or the game ends in a draw.
- The game announces the winner or declares a draw at the end of each round.

## Getting Started

To run the game, you will need a C++ compiler installed on your system.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/IzanamiiDevv/TicTacToe-CPP.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd TicTacToe-CPP`
3. Compile the source code: `build or click the bat file`
4. Run the executable: `./tictactoe`

## Download

## How to Play

- The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns entering the coordinates of their move (row and column).
- The coordinates are 1-indexed, so valid inputs are in the range [1-9].
- The game continues until one player wins or the board is full (resulting in a draw).

## Rules

1. Players take turns marking a cell on the grid with their symbol (X or O).
2. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
3. If all cells on the grid are filled and no player has won, the game is declared a draw.
